# Traefik can be configured to provide basic HTTP authentication (see https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth/)
#
# Passwords must be hashed using MD5, SHA1, or BCrypt. The `htpasswd` utility can be used to generate passwords.
# Note that, in a kubernetes secret, the user:password string pair must be base64 encoded.
#
# Refer to tasks/basic_auth_credentials.yml to see how this is done with the `htpasswd` utility.
