# Includes tasks to setup the Lets-Encrypt CA using cert-manager
#
# It also ensures that Kubernetes CoreDNS will forward DNS queries to public DNS servers as opposed
# to the local resolvers on the node.
#
# We do this because if the nodeâ€™s resolver points to an internal network DNS server (say, your router or an internal DNS forwarder),
# and that internal DNS server has wildcard overrides for your domain or routes outbound traffic in non-standard ways,
# it might resolve "acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org" to the public ingress IP (or worse, intercept outbound HTTPS traffic altogether).
