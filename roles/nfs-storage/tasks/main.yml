# Leverage the `nfs-subdir-external-provisioner` to create a storage class that can dynamically create a persistent volume.
#
# See: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner
#
# In contrast to manually creating a persistent volume and persistent volume claim, this dynamic method cedes the lifecycle
# of the persistent volume over to the storage class itself.
#
# This can be used as an external storage for AlertManager and Prometheus, ensuring multi-node level durability (of the storage).
#
# This role drew its inspiration from: https://fabianlee.org/2022/01/12/kubernetes-nfs-mount-using-dynamic-volume-and-storage-class/
#
# Refers to the hosts variables in '../inventory/hosts.yml and group variables in '../inventory/group_vars/' and is intended to be
# executed on the node that will act as the NFS Server (typically the master node).
